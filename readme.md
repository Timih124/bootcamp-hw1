# Bootcamp Homework 1 Accessibility 
**Note** 

# Header
Changed Nav and Header. Cleaned up and made the css classes narrow bundles

# Changed the image to article
Didnt think this needed to be the focus for the search enginges so placed in article

# Main

Added the main and changed div to section to give it much cleaner look. Will also be more accessible too.

Changed the whole pange to semantic html to clean it up and make it more accessible for everyone. 

# Aside 

Change the divs to section, and out of the main part of the body.

# Footer
Didnt do much here besides change the semantic
